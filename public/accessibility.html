  <h1>Introduction to WCAG and Their Versions</h1>

  <p>The <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</strong> are a set of international standards developed to ensure that web content is accessible to all users, including people with disabilities. These guidelines help developers and designers create inclusive digital experiences that are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.</p>

  <h2>Purpose of WCAG</h2>
  <p>WCAG aims to remove accessibility barriers on the web by providing clear principles and testable success criteria. These guidelines are widely used by governments, organizations, and developers to meet legal and usability requirements.</p>

  <h2>Principles of WCAG</h2>
  <p>WCAG is based on four key principles, often abbreviated as POUR:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Perceivable:</strong> Information and interface components must be presented in ways users can perceive (e.g., alternative text for images).</li>
    <li><strong>Operable:</strong> Interface components must be usable with a keyboard and accessible through navigation aids.</li>
    <li><strong>Understandable:</strong> Information and operation must be clear and simple to understand.</li>
    <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Content must be compatible with current and future user tools, including assistive technologies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Versions of WCAG</h2>

  <h3>WCAG 1.0 (1999)</h3>
  <p>The first version, WCAG 1.0, focused on HTML and provided 14 guidelines with checkpoints categorized into three priority levels. However, it became outdated as web technologies evolved.</p>

  <h3>WCAG 2.0 (2008)</h3>
  <p>WCAG 2.0 introduced a technology-independent approach and structured the guidelines around the POUR principles. It included 12 guidelines and 61 success criteria, each assigned to Level A, AA, or AAA.</p>

  <h3>WCAG 2.1 (2018)</h3>
  <p>WCAG 2.1 built upon version 2.0, adding 17 new success criteria to address mobile accessibility, low vision, and cognitive disabilities. It is widely adopted today and recognized by many accessibility laws.</p>

  <h3>WCAG 2.2 (2023)</h3>
  <p>WCAG 2.2 added 9 more success criteria focused on improving the experience for users with cognitive impairments and those using mobile devices. It retains backward compatibility with WCAG 2.0 and 2.1.</p>

  <h3>WCAG 3.0 (In Development)</h3>
  <p>WCAG 3.0, also known as the Accessibility Guidelines (AG), is currently in draft. It aims to provide a more flexible and comprehensive framework that covers a broader range of disabilities and digital content types. Unlike the numbered levels of success criteria in earlier versions, WCAG 3.0 proposes a scoring model to rate accessibility.</p>

  <h1>Accessibility Automation Tools</h1>

  <p>Accessibility automation tools help developers and testers identify accessibility issues in web applications and websites quickly. These tools scan code and content against recognized standards like WCAG and provide suggestions for improvement.</p>

  <h2>Why Use Automation Tools?</h2>
  <p>Automation tools make accessibility testing more efficient by catching common issues early in the development cycle. They save time and effort while increasing the likelihood of building accessible digital products. However, they should be used alongside manual testing for the best results.</p>

  <h2>Popular Accessibility Automation Tools</h2>

  <h3>1. Axe by Deque Systems</h3>
  <p><strong>Axe</strong> is one of the most popular accessibility testing libraries and browser extensions. It provides detailed reports and integrates easily with development environments and CI/CD pipelines.</p>

  <h3>2. Lighthouse</h3>
  <p><strong>Lighthouse</strong> is an open-source tool built into Google Chrome DevTools. It audits websites for performance, SEO, and accessibility, and provides a score with actionable insights.</p>

  <h3>3. WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)</h3>
  <p><strong>WAVE</strong> is a browser extension developed by WebAIM that visually highlights accessibility errors, alerts, and features directly on the web page being tested.</p>

  <h3>4. Tenon</h3>
  <p><strong>Tenon</strong> is an API-based accessibility testing tool that integrates into development workflows. It supports both automated and manual testing strategies.</p>

  <h3>5. Pa11y</h3>
  <p><strong>Pa11y</strong> is a command-line tool that runs automated accessibility tests against web pages and generates easy-to-read reports. It is suitable for developers comfortable with scripting.</p>

  <h3>6. Accessibility Insights</h3>
  <p><strong>Accessibility Insights</strong> by Microsoft is a browser extension that helps detect accessibility issues and provides guided assessments and automated checks based on WCAG standards.</p>

  <h3>7. NVDA Developer Toolkit</h3>
  <p>Although not an automation tool, the <strong>NVDA Developer Toolkit</strong> is essential for developers who want to test how screen readers interact with their content.</p>

  <h2>Limitations of Automation</h2>
  <p>While automation tools are powerful, they can only detect 20% to 50% of accessibility issues. Manual testing using screen readers, keyboard navigation, and user feedback is necessary to ensure full accessibility compliance.</p>
