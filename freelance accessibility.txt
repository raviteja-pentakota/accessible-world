Dear Manager,
My name is Raviteja, and I am reaching out to explore the opportunity of working with your team as a part-time Accessibility Engineer. I have over 9 years of experience in Accessibility Testing, with strong expertise in web, mobile, and document accessibility in alignment with WCAG guidelines.
Being a resident of Visakhapatnam, I am available for face-to-face discussions if required. To make our collaboration risk-free, I am happy to offer the first few hours of my work free of charge, so you can evaluate the quality of my testing before assigning a full project.
I have attached my resume for your reference. Please let me know if we can connect to discuss how I can support your accessibility needs.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best regards,
Raviteja
