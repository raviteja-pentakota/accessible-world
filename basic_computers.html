                    <p>Welcome to the Basic Computer Course for Blind Users! This course will guide you through the essential concepts of using a computer effectively with a screen reader like NVDA.</p>
                    <h3>What is a computer?</h3>
                    <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes information. It takes input, stores and processes data, and then produces output. Think of it as a powerful tool for various tasks, from writing documents to Browse the internet.</p>
                    <h3>Types of Computers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Desktop Computers:</strong> These are typically stationary and consist of separate components like a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and a main computer unit (tower).</li>
                        <li><strong>Laptop Computers:</strong> Portable computers that integrate all components into a single, compact unit, including a built-in screen, keyboard, and trackpad.</li>
                        <li><strong>Smartphones and Tablets:</strong> While not traditional computers, these devices function similarly, allowing you to perform many computer-like tasks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Basic Parts of a Computer</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> Used for typing text and entering commands.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor (Display):</strong> Shows visual information. For blind users, a screen reader converts this visual information into spoken words.</li>
                        <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> The "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mouse:</strong> A pointing device used for navigation. While primarily visual, some tasks can be performed with the mouse, but we'll focus on keyboard navigation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speakers/Headphones:</strong> Essential for hearing the screen reader's output.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Input and Output Devices</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> These allow you to send information to the computer. Examples include the keyboard, mouse, microphone, and scanner.</li>
                        <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> These allow the computer to send information back to you. Examples include the monitor, printer, and speakers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Powering On and Shutting Down</h3>
                    <p>To power on a desktop computer, locate the power button on the computer tower and press it. For a laptop, the power button is usually on the keyboard or side. To shut down, press the <strong>Windows key</strong>, then use the <strong>Tab key</strong> to navigate to the power options and select "Shut down." You can also press <strong>Alt + F4</strong> from the desktop to open the shutdown dialog.</p>

                        content: `
                            <p>A screen reader is crucial software for blind and visually impaired individuals, converting text and images on the screen into speech or braille output.</p>
                            <h3>Definition</h3>
                            <p>A screen reader is a software application that interprets the information displayed on a computer screen and presents it to the user in a non-visual format, typically synthesized speech or a refreshable braille display. It allows you to interact with the operating system and applications.</p>
                            <h3>How it Works</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>It reads out loud text on the screen, including menus, buttons, and document content.</li>
                                <li>It describes images and other graphical elements, if they have proper alternative text.</li>
                                <li>It allows navigation using the keyboard, as opposed to a mouse.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) is a popular, free, and open-source screen reader. You can download it from the official NV Access website.</p>
                            <h3>Download and Installation</h3>
                            <p>Visit <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/" target="_blank">www.nvaccess.org</a> to download the latest stable version of NVDA. After downloading, run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts. It's recommended to install NVDA to your hard drive so it can start automatically.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Default Hotkey:</strong> After installation, you can usually launch NVDA by pressing <strong>Ctrl + Alt + N</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>From Start Menu:</strong> Press the <strong>Windows key</strong>, type "NVDA", and press <strong>Enter</strong> when "NVDA" is announced.</li>
                                <li><strong>Portable Version:</strong> If you downloaded the portable version, navigate to its folder and press <strong>Enter</strong> on the "nvda_portable" executable.</li>

                            <p>The primary hotkey to toggle NVDA on or off (start or stop speech) is <strong>Ctrl + Alt + N</strong>. This is useful for situations where you might need to temporarily mute the screen reader.</p>
                            <h3>Temporarily Disable Speech</h3>
                            <p>To temporarily disable NVDA's speech without exiting the program, press <strong>NVDA key + S</strong> (where NVDA key is Insert by default or Caps Lock if you've changed it). Press it again to resume speech.</p>
                            <h3>Exiting NVDA Completely</h3>
                            <p>To close NVDA completely, press <strong>NVDA key + Q</strong>. You will be prompted to confirm if you want to exit. Press <strong>Enter</strong> for "Yes" or <strong>Tab</strong> to "No" and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>

                            <h3>Keyboard Layouts in NVDA</h3>
                            <p>NVDA offers different keyboard layouts to suit your preference. The default is "Desktop layout," which uses the Insert key as the NVDA modifier key. You can also switch to "Laptop layout," where the Caps Lock key acts as the NVDA modifier. To change this, go to NVDA Menu (<strong>NVDA key + N</strong>) > Preferences > Keyboard.</p>

                            <p>The keyboard is laid out similar to a typewriter. Your hands should be placed on the home row keys: F and J have tactile bumps for easy identification. The left index finger rests on F, and the right index finger on J. Practice typing by placing your fingers correctly and reaching for surrounding keys.</p>
